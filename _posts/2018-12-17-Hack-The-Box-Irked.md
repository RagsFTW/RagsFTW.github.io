title: Hack The Box: Irked
---

My first [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) system (and now my first blog post) is in the books!

For my first HTB system, I chose "Irked".  Irked was labeled as a "easy to medium", so I thought it would be perfect to get my feet wet.  Overall, my impression of Irked was positive.  I thought the advertised difficult was accurate: there were things I knew off the top of my head, and there were things I had to Google.  Without further delay, let's get root.txt!
