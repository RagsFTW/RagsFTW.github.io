title: Hack The Box - Irked
---

My first [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) system (and now my first blog post) is in the books!

For my first HTB system, I chose "Irked".  Irked was labeled as a "easy to medium", so I thought it would be perfect to get my feet wet.  Overall, my impression of Irked was positive.  I thought the advertised difficult was accurate: there were things I knew off the top of my head, and there were things I had to Google.  Without further delay, let's get root.txt!

## Where To Start
Tackling a Hack The Box (HTB) machine is always going to be a bit different than a production system at a company, but the methodology is roughly the same.  While there is some debate over the actual steps, they will typically contain the following phases: Recon, Scanning, Exploitation, and Post-Exploitation.  Some may add in phases like scoping or reporting, or have different names for these phases.  

## Scanning
Wait? What happened to the Recon phase?  This is one of those things that is different about a HTB challenge.  Since I already know what my target is, I don't really have to do recon, and can just move into scanning.  If there were an actual company target, or something I would do professionally, then I would be learning as much as possible about the company and their systems minus any actual network or phyiscal interaction with the systems.
