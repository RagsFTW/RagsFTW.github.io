title: Hack The Box: Irked
---

My fist [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) system (and now my first blog post) is in the books!

For my first HTB system, I chose "Irked".  Irked was labeled as a "easy to medium", so I thought it would be perfect to get my feet wet.  Overall, my impression of Irked was positive.  I thought the advertised difficult was accurate: there were things i knew off the top of my head, and things I had to Google.  Without further delay, let's get root.txt!


Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
